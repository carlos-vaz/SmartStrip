## Serial Monitors
Programs that use the Arduino to eavesdrop on the serial lines of the ATmega and 
print the values to your computer terminal. 

Connect the RX/TX lines of the ATmega to your peripheral device as well as to the 
Arduino to monitor the communication. When the Arduino is powered off, the eavesdropping 
lines may pull RX/TX low, thus preventing communication. Therefore, the Arduino must 
always be powered when the eavesdropping wires are connected.
